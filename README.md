üêç Python Mini Challenges: Fun with Strings & Lists
üìå Overview:
This experiment consists of a set of simple Python problems for beginners that have been answered in a Jupyter Notebook. It is intended to assist you in practicing basic programming ideas, including list unpacking, string manipulation, and basic algorithms.

üéØ Focus of this Project:
-Strengthening Python fundamentals.
-Practicing problem-solving with code.
-Writing solutions that are simple, readable, and reusable.

This experiment focuses on three(3) problems:
1. ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM: Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters
in alphabetical order.

2. EMOTICON PROBLEM: Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence
as a string, replace the words smile, grin, sad, and mad with their corresponding emoticon

3. UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM: Unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first,
middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three
variables.
